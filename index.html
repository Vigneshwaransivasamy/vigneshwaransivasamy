  <h1>About Me: I Plan Ahead</h1>
  <p>I'm someone who likes to be ready for anything. Some might call it being negative, but I think it's smart to be prepared.</p>

  <h2>I Love Reading</h2>
  <p>I've started reading a lot during my long trips to work. I listen to audiobooks about money, habits, and other interesting topics.</p>

  <h2>I'm Learning About Machine Learning</h2>
  <p>I spent a year working with machine learning and found it really interesting. I like learning about how it can change things in the future.</p>

  <h2>Living Simply</h2>
  <p>I believe in not spending too much and only buying what I really need. This way, I make sure I'm working towards what I want in life.</p>

  <h2>My Investments: Gold and Real Estate</h2>
  <p>I only invest in things I understand well, like gold and houses or land. This makes me feel more secure about where my money is.</p>

  <h2>Building My Dream</h2>
  <p>I think it's important to work on your own goals. If not, you might end up helping someone else reach theirs instead of your own.</p>
