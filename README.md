### Hi there 👋

# About Me: I Plan Ahead 📘

I'm someone who likes to be ready for anything. Some people might call it being negative, but I think it's smart to be prepared.

## I Love Reading 📖

I've started reading a lot during my long trips to work. I listen to audiobooks about money, habits, and other interesting topics.

## I'm Learning About Machine Learning 🤖

I spent a year working with machine learning and found it really interesting. I like learning about how it can change things in the future.

## Living Simply 🌿

I believe in not spending too much and only buying what I really need. This way, I make sure I'm working towards what I want in life.

## My Investments: Gold and Real Estate 🏠💰

I only invest in things I understand well, like gold and houses or land. This makes me feel more secure about where my money is.

## Building My Dream 🏗️

I think it's important to work on your own goals. If not, you might end up helping someone else reach theirs instead of your own.
